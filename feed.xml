      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with Help and Manual, RoboHelp, and MadCap Flare and I’ve become accustomed to being able to single source to webhelp, pdf, chm and other formats quickly.  I’d like to have one of those systems for my own writing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the commercial help authoring products has great features, and if someone was to give me a free copy, I would happily work away. However, Murphy’s Law states that if I buy one of these products, my next project will be in one of the others. And by the time I return to the product I purchased it will be out of date.  So how to set up my home writing system without spending too much? Options abound.  In all sorts of directions. Everything seems so expensive.  Lower cost options: Scribner? Jekyll and git? Gosh. OxygenXML has a $200 version for home use.  Hmmm… maybe? No, that didn’t work out.  I looked at Jekyll but read that it works best on Mac, and although I have a Mac, I do most of my work on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to try the Wintersmith site generator.  In the process I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to host a free web site on Github: &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmdocs.github.io&quot;&gt;jmdocs.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More about Markdown, and the various different types of Markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a static web site generator works. For Wintersmith, this included an intro to npm, jade, coffeescript plus a fair bit of time on css.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; This project has taken me quite far from writing while doing the setup. It will be interesting to see how comfortable it is to work with Markdown and pushing posts out. How this sort of system will work for documentation (and pdfs) is still a question. So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the developer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/articles/johan-nordberg.com&quot;&gt;Wintersmith&lt;/a&gt;, as well as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid&quot;&gt;Simple Grid&lt;/a&gt; - for getting me started on how grids work. Part way along I switched to pureio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yearlonghackathon.com/&quot;&gt;YearlongHackathon&lt;/a&gt;  - for explaining how to add the partials section for Jade that I was able to use to auto generate the menu sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexnormand.com/&quot;&gt;Alex Normand&lt;/a&gt; - for having a great site, from which I got the idea to use pureio.css.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewphilipclark.com/&quot;&gt;Andrew Clark - 8 Nov 13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so many other articles that were read in the google browsathon that it took to get this initial web site up!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Technical Writer and I created this blog to see how a static site generator might used for documentation projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the idea to try this out after reading this &lt;a href=&quot;http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/09/29/how-are-you-doing-docs/&quot;&gt;I’d Rather be Writing&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the blog now, but I’m still looking into how this might be used for documentation. There are a lot of pieces to these things! When I have time I’d like to learn more about pdf generators, node.js, responsive design, and several hundred other things that might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
