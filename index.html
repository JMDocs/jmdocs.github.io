          <div class="postContent"><p><strong>Adobe Captivate</strong> and <strong>Articulate Storyline</strong> are used for html and elearning projects. I worked through the main features of both programs and created the demos listed below. It was fun to try both products and I would enjoy working more with either, if a project came&nbsp;up. </p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Security/story.html">Demo 1 - Computer Security</a><br>Articulate Storyline project (non-responsive, scales to fit screen). This demo uses a few of Storyline’s quiz&nbsp;features.</p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Bike/story.html">Demo 2 - <span class="caps">RAID</span> Alpine Slider</a><br>Articulate Storyline project (non-responsive, scales to fit screen). This slider uses transitions and layers, as well as some of the animation features available in&nbsp;Storyline.</p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Garmin/index.html">Demo 3 - Garmin Help</a><br>Adobe Captivate project (responsive). I got this idea on a bike ride when a friend told me she didn’t know what the buttons on her Garmin do. She was afraid to press the wrong button. She always rides with her phone on hand, so the idea would be to have a touch based help description of the basic features to consult over coffee, or on the&nbsp;go. </p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Survey/index.html">Demo 4 - Random Nonesense Survey</a><br>Adobe Captivate project (responsive). This survey uses Captivate variables to track the answers to the questions and then displays the survey results in the final screen. It’s a bit long for a demo, but if you click through you’ll come to the results screen at the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Colorbars/multiscreen.html">Demo 5 - Colorbars</a><br>Adobe Captivate project (non-responsive). I got the idea from a challenge on the Articulate Storyline site and decided to create it in Captivate while testing different Captivate&nbsp;features.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/Preprocessors.html" class="postTitle">Do I need Sass or Less?</a></h2>
            <p class="postDate">Posted Date: Oct 16,  2015</p>
          </header>
          <div class="postContent"><p>In reading around on the web about how to implement Wintersmith, I came upon many blogs about the benefits of using Sass/Less for writing and maintaining&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<p>Sass, Less, Coffeescript, and <span class="caps">HAML</span> are all preprocessors. Wintersmith uses the Coffeescript preprocessor and the Jade template engine, which is based on the HAML&nbsp;preprocessor.</p>
<p>Preprocessors are designed to make it easier to maintain code. The code is written in the preprocessor format, and then is converted to <span class="caps">CSS</span>/Javascript/HTML so that the information can be read on the&nbsp;web.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Sass and Less translate into&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span></li>
<li>Coffeescript translates into&nbsp;Javascript</li>
<li><span class="caps">HAML</span> translates into&nbsp;HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of information there. I’ll definitely be leaving Coffeescript and <span class="caps">HAML</span>/Jade until a later date. But would it make sense to start now with Sass or Less&nbsp;now?</p>

            <p class="postDate">Posted Date: Oct 8,  2015</p>
          </header>
          <div class="postContent"><p>Wintersmith can be set to display the first section of a text with a ‘read more’ link to the full&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>I learned from <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/creating-posts-custom-metadata-data-wintersmith/">Brian Rinaldi’s site</a> that the “read more” link is automatically inserted whenever one of the following is inserted into an article&nbsp;page:</p>
<ul>
<li>a heading at the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> level</li>
<li>the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag </li>
<li>the span code: <code>&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve started using the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag and it seems to be working.  I updated the css file for <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> with “display:none” so that a line doesn’t display in the&nbsp;post.</p>

          </header>
          <div class="postContent"><p>When using with different <span class="caps">HAT</span> systems, I tend to work with two or three image styles. In basic Markdown, there is only the img tag itself to work with. However, classes can be added by inserting html into the&nbsp;Markdown: </p>
<p><strong>Basic Markdown</strong>: <code>![Image Ideas](/img/manageimages.png)</code> <strong>versus</strong><br><strong><span class="caps">HTML</span> entered into Markdown:</strong> <code>&lt;img class=&quot;testing&quot; src=&quot;/img/manageimages.png&quot;&gt;</code> </p>
<p>Both methods just use one line, so it does not add complexity to use the <span class="caps">HTML</span> syntax. For now I’ll just use the basic Markdown syntax with an img (centered, with a max-width of 100%). When I need more styling, I’ll start using the HTML&nbsp;syntax. </p>
<p>As with most areas to do with responsive design, one topic leads to another, which leads to more topics. One recommendation I can take advantage of now is to use TinyPNG as I go to make the pngs smaller. Topics for future research&nbsp;include:</p>
<p><img src="/img/manageimages.png" alt="Image Ideas"></p>

          </header>
          <div class="postContent"><p>I set up Wintersmith as an experiment to try out a static blog, and to try hosting it on a free web location (github). I looked at Jekyll but read that it works best on Mac, and although I have a Mac, I do most of my work on Windows. So I decided to try the Wintersmith site generator. In the process of creating this blog I&nbsp;learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to host a free web site on Github: <a href="http://jmdocs.github.io">jmdocs.github.io</a>.</li>
<li>More about Markdown, and the various different types of&nbsp;Markdown.</li>
<li>How a static web site generator works. For Wintersmith, this included an intro to npm, jade, coffeescript plus a fair bit of time on&nbsp;css.</li>
<li>Using purio.css to format a responsive web&nbsp;site.</li>
<li>More about html editors: Brackets, Notepad++, and Sublime Text. I’ve settled on Brackets for&nbsp;now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The Wintersmith system made it possible to create a responsive blog that is easy to update and manage in a free github&nbsp;repository. </p>
<p>Thanks to the developer of <a href="/articles/johan-nordberg.com">Wintersmith</a>, as well&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid">Simple Grid</a> - for getting me started on how grids work. Part way along I switched to&nbsp;pureio.</li>
<li><a href="http://yearlonghackathon.com/">YearlongHackathon</a>  - for explaining how to add the partials section for Jade that I was able to use to auto generate the menu&nbsp;sidebar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alexnormand.com/">Alex Normand</a> - for having a great site, from which I got the idea to use&nbsp;pureio.css.</li>

<p>and so many other articles that were read in the google browsathon that it took to get this initial web site&nbsp;up!</p>
