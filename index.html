          <div class="postContent"><p>Wintersmith can be set to display the first section of a text with a ‘read more’ link to the full&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>I learned from <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/creating-posts-custom-metadata-data-wintersmith/">Brian Rinaldi’s site</a> that the “read more” link is automatically inserted whenever one of the following is inserted into an article&nbsp;page:</p>
<ul>
<li>a heading at the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> level</li>
<li>the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag </li>
<li>the span code: <code>&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve started using the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag and it seems to be working.  I updated the css file for <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> with “display:none” so that a line doesn’t display in the&nbsp;post.</p>

          </header>
          <div class="postContent"><p>In reading around on the web about how to implement Wintersmith, I came upon many blogs about the benefits of using Sass/Less for writing and maintaining&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<p>Sass, Less, Coffeescript, and <span class="caps">HAML</span> are all preprocessors. Wintersmith uses the Coffeescript preprocessor and the Jade template engine, which is based on the HAML&nbsp;preprocessor.</p>
<p>Preprocessors are designed to make it easier to maintain code. The code is written in the preprocessor format, and then is converted to <span class="caps">CSS</span>/Javascript/HTML so that the information can be read on the&nbsp;web.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Sass and Less translate into&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span></li>
<li>Coffeescript translates into&nbsp;Javascript</li>
<li><span class="caps">HAML</span> translates into&nbsp;HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of information there. I’ll definitely be leaving Coffeescript and <span class="caps">HAML</span>/Jade until a later date. But would it make sense to start now with Sass or Less&nbsp;now?</p>

          <div class="postContent"><p>When using with different <span class="caps">HAT</span> systems, I tend to work with two or three image styles. In basic Markdown, there is only the img tag itself to work with. However, classes can be added by inserting html into the&nbsp;Markdown: </p>
<p><strong>Basic Markdown</strong>: <code>![Image Ideas](/img/manageimages.png)</code> <strong>versus</strong><br><strong><span class="caps">HTML</span> entered into Markdown:</strong> <code>&lt;img class=&quot;testing&quot; src=&quot;/img/manageimages.png&quot;&gt;</code> </p>
<p>Both methods just use one line, so it does not add complexity to use the <span class="caps">HTML</span> syntax. For now I’ll just use the basic Markdown syntax with an img (centered, with a max-width of 100%). When I need more styling, I’ll start using the HTML&nbsp;syntax. </p>
<p>As with most areas to do with responsive design, one topic leads to another, which leads to more topics. One recommendation I can take advantage of now is to use TinyPNG as I go to make the pngs smaller. Topics for future research&nbsp;include:</p>
<p><img src="/img/manageimages.png" alt="Image Ideas"></p>

          <div class="postContent"><p>I’ve worked with Help and Manual, RoboHelp, and MadCap Flare and I’ve become accustomed to being able to single source to webhelp, pdf, chm and other formats quickly.  I’d like to have one of those systems for my own&nbsp;writing.  </p>
<p>Each of the commercial help authoring products has great features, and if someone was to give me a free copy, I would happily work away. However, Murphy’s Law states that if I buy one of these products, my next project will be in one of the others. And by the time I return to the product I purchased it will be out of date.  So how to set up my home writing system without spending too much? Options abound.  In all sorts of directions. Everything seems so expensive.  Lower cost options: Scribner? Jekyll and git? Gosh. OxygenXML has a $200 version for home use.  Hmmm… maybe? No, that didn’t work out.  I looked at Jekyll but read that it works best on Mac, and although I have a Mac, I do most of my work on&nbsp;Windows. </p>

          <div class="postContent"><p>I am a Technical Writer and I created this blog to see how a static site generator might used for documentation&nbsp;projects. </p>
<p>I got the idea to try this out after reading this <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/09/29/how-are-you-doing-docs/">I’d Rather be Writing</a>&nbsp;article.</p>
<p>I have the blog now, but I’m still looking into how this might be used for documentation. There are a lot of pieces to these things! When I have time I’d like to learn more about pdf generators, node.js, responsive design, and several hundred other things that might be&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p>It’s a work in&nbsp;progress.</p>
