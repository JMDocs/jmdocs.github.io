          <h1>Why Wintersmith?</h1>
          <p class="postDate">Oct 6,  2015</p>
          <div class="postContent"><p>I’ve worked with Help and Manual, RoboHelp, and MadCap Flare and I’ve become accustomed to being able to single source to webhelp, pdf, chm and other formats quickly.  I’d like to have one of those systems for my own&nbsp;writing.  </p>
<p>Each of the commercial help authoring products has great features, and if someone was to give me a free copy, I would happily work away. However, Murphy’s Law states that if I buy one of these products, my next project will be in one of the others. And by the time I return to the product I purchased it will be out of date.  So how to set up my home writing system without spending too much? Options abound.  In all sorts of directions. Everything seems so expensive.  Lower cost options: Scribner? Jekyll and git? Gosh. OxygenXML has a $200 version for home use.  Hmmm… maybe? No, that didn’t work out.  I looked at Jekyll but read that it works best on Mac, and although I have a Mac, I do most of my work on&nbsp;Windows. </p>

<p>So I decided to try the Wintersmith site generator. I’m not sure yet where this is going! But in the process I&nbsp;learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to host a free web site on Github: <a href="http://jmdocs.github.io">jmdocs.github.io</a>.</li>
<li>More about Markdown, and the various different types of&nbsp;Markdown.</li>
<li>How a static web site generator works. For Wintersmith, this included an intro to npm, jade, coffeescript plus a fair bit of time on&nbsp;css.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> This project has taken me quite far from writing while doing the setup. It will be interesting to see how comfortable it is to work with Markdown and pushing posts out. How this sort of system will work for documentation (and pdfs) is still a question. But now I have a blog to use while I continue the&nbsp;investigation.</p>
<p>Thanks to the developer of <a href="/articles/johan-nordberg.com">Wintersmith</a>, as well&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid">Simple Grid</a> - for getting me started on how grids work. Part way along I switched to&nbsp;pureio.</li>
<li><a href="http://yearlonghackathon.com/">YearlongHackathon</a>  - for explaining how to add the partials section for Jade that I was able to use to auto generate the menu&nbsp;sidebar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alexnormand.com/">Alex Normand</a> - for having a great site, from which I got the idea to use&nbsp;pureio.css.</li>

</ul>
<p>and so many other articles that were read in the google browsathon that it took to get this initial web site&nbsp;up!</p>
