          <h1>Why Wintersmith?</h1>
          <p class="postDate">Oct 6,  2015</p>
          <div class="postContent"><p>I’ve worked with Help and Manual, RoboHelp, and MadCap Flare and I’ve become accustomed to being able to single source to webhelp, pdf, chm and other formats&nbsp;quickly.    </p>
<p>Each of the commercial help authoring products has great features, and if someone was to give me a free copy, I would happily work away. However, Murphy’s Law states that if I buy one of these products, my next project will be in one of the others. And by the time I return to the product I purchased it will be out of date.  For writing systems options abound.  In all sorts of directions. Everything seems so expensive.  Lower cost options:  OxygenXML? Jekyll and&nbsp;git?</p>
<p>OxygenXML has a $200 version for home use.  I downloaded the trial version and created a simple <span class="caps">DITA</span> project and then wanted to test the outputs. The company documentation  includes a topic about PDF customization: <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/17.0/ug-editor/#topics/dita_pdf_output_customization.html"><span class="caps">DITA</span> to PDF Customization</a>, but I could not get it to work. I emailed customer support to ask if a person would need to know <span class="caps">XSLT</span> to change the default PDF output and the response was yes, it requires a knowledge of XSLT <strong><span class="caps">OR</span></strong> it can be done using <span class="caps">CSS</span> customizations and the commercial Prince XML engine (cost $500US). The cost of buying both OxygenXML and Prince brings the purchase of OxygenXML up to about the same cost as the help authoring software. So that ended the OxygenXML&nbsp;experiment.</p>
<p>I looked at Jekyll but read that it works best on Mac, and although I have a Mac, I do most of my work on&nbsp;Windows. </p>
<hr>

<p>So I decided to try the Wintersmith site generator. In the process of creating this blog I&nbsp;learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to host a free web site on Github: <a href="http://jmdocs.github.io">jmdocs.github.io</a>.</li>
<li>More about Markdown, and the various different types of&nbsp;Markdown.</li>
<li>How a static web site generator works. For Wintersmith, this included an intro to npm, jade, coffeescript plus a fair bit of time on&nbsp;css.</li>
<li>How to use purio.css to format a responsive web&nbsp;site.</li>
<li>More about html editors: Brackets, Notepad++, and Sublime Text. I’ve settled on Brackets for&nbsp;now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> The Wintersmith system made it possible to create a responsive blog that is easy to update and manage in a free github repository. As a documentation system, it would be very difficult to use and is lacking major features. For example, a <span class="caps">PDF</span> output does not exist and would need to be added using Pandoc or another product. The commercial help authoring systems are looking better and better.  But now I have a blog to use while I continue the&nbsp;investigation.</p>
<p>Thanks to the developer of <a href="/articles/johan-nordberg.com">Wintersmith</a>, as well&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid">Simple Grid</a> - for getting me started on how grids work. Part way along I switched to&nbsp;pureio.</li>
<li><a href="http://yearlonghackathon.com/">YearlongHackathon</a>  - for explaining how to add the partials section for Jade that I was able to use to auto generate the menu&nbsp;sidebar.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alexnormand.com/">Alex Normand</a> - for having a great site, from which I got the idea to use&nbsp;pureio.css.</li>

</ul>
<p>and so many other articles that were read in the google browsathon that it took to get this initial web site&nbsp;up!</p>
