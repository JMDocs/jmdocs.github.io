          <div class="postContent"><p><strong>Adobe Captivate</strong> and <strong>Articulate Storyline</strong> are used for html and elearning projects. I worked through the main features of both programs and created the demos listed below. It was fun to try both products and I would enjoy working more with either, if a project came&nbsp;up. </p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Security/story.html">Demo 1 - Computer Security</a><br>Articulate Storyline project (non-responsive, scales to fit screen). This demo uses a few of Storyline’s quiz&nbsp;features.</p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Bike/story.html">Demo 2 - Slider</a><br>Articulate Storyline project (non-responsive, scales to fit screen). This slider uses transitions and layers, as well as some of the animation features available in&nbsp;Storyline.</p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Garmin/index.html">Demo 3 - Garmin</a><br>Adobe Captivate project (responsive). I got this idea on a bike ride when a friend told me she didn’t know what the buttons on her Garmin do. She was afraid to press the wrong button. She always rides with her phone on hand, so the idea would be to have a touch based help description of the basic features to consult over coffee, or on the&nbsp;go. </p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Survey/index.html">Demo 4 - Survey</a><br>Adobe Captivate project (responsive). This survey uses Captivate variables to track the answers to the questions and then displays the survey results in the final screen. It’s a bit long for a demo, but if you click through you’ll come to the results screen at the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><a href="http://jmdocs.github.io/Colorbars/multiscreen.html">Demo 5 - Colorbars</a><br>Adobe Captivate project (non-responsive). I got the idea from a challenge on the Articulate Storyline site and decided to create it in Captivate while testing different Captivate&nbsp;features.</p>
