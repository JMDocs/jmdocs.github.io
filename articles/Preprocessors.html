          <h1>Do I need Sass or Less?</h1>
          <p class="postDate">Oct 16,  2015</p>
          <div class="postContent"><p>In reading around on the web about how to implement Wintersmith, I came upon many blogs about the benefits of using Sass/Less for writing and maintaining&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
<p>Sass, Less, Coffeescript, and <span class="caps">HAML</span> are all preprocessors. Wintersmith uses the Coffeescript preprocessor and the Jade template engine, which is based on the HAML&nbsp;preprocessor.</p>
<p>Preprocessors are designed to make it easier to maintain code. The code is written in the preprocessor format, and then is converted to <span class="caps">CSS</span>/Javascript/HTML so that the information can be read on the&nbsp;web.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Sass and Less translate into&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span></li>
<li>Coffeescript translates into&nbsp;Javascript</li>
<li><span class="caps">HAML</span> translates into&nbsp;HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a lot of information there. I’ll definitely be leaving Coffeescript and <span class="caps">HAML</span>/Jade until a later date. But would it make sense to start now with Sass or Less&nbsp;now?</p>
<h2 id="how-does-sass-less-help-">How does Sass/Less&nbsp;help?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong><span class="caps">CSS</span> Nesting</strong>. This makes it easier to read the <span class="caps">CSS</span> file when you are styling a web&nbsp;site.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Variables</strong>. In Sass you can define a variable for an item like a color that is used in many places in the web site. The variable is declared once. The variable name is used each time an element is set to the color.  If the color changes for the web site, only the variable needs to be&nbsp;updated.  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mixins</strong>. A mixin allows you to define a snippet in <span class="caps">CSS</span> so you can use the same code in many places. You can write your own mixins, or use a library like the Compass or Bourbon. Mixins are often used for the repetitive CSS that is required for cross browser&nbsp;compatibility.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="so-do-i-need-sass-or-less-">So… Do I need Sass or&nbsp;Less?</h2>
<p>While it would be good to use one of these, it sounds like the value of using it would come from adding it along with a library (Compass/Bourbon), so there would be the inevitable learning curve for that. That’s after deciding whether to start with Sass or Less. If Sass, there are the complexities of adding the node.js version (libSass) and learning how to compile it into <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and add it into Wintersmith. For now I am answering my question with a no.  But it’s on the list for the future. Along with Coffeescript and HAML/Jade… it’s a long&nbsp;list.</p>
